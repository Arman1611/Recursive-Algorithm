# Recursive-Algorithm
## HACTOBERFEST

Make your first pull request.

### Task:
-Write any algorithm of your choice in recursive form in any language.

A recursive method is a method that is defined in terms of itself. The general idea behind recursion is that a problem lends itself to a recursive solution if the problem can be broken down into a smaller version of the same problem. A non-CS example of this is the Matroyshka doll. A mathematical example of this is the computation of the factorial of a number. factorial(N) is N*factorial(N-1).


### Steps: 
- Fork this Repository using the button at the top
- Clone your forked repository to your pc
- Create a new branch for your modifications (ie. ```git branch new-user``` and check it out ```git checkout new-user``` and ``` git checkout -b new-user```)
- Create your file in a folder and set the folder name to the algorithm's name.
- Add your files (```git add -A```), commit (```git commit -m "added myself"```) and push (```git push origin new-user```)
- Create a pull request
- Star this repository
- Wait for Pull Request to merge
- Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!


### Note:
- Upload your own file. 
- Do not modify other's file. 
- Give some working test cases. 
- PR for similar implementation in similar language won't be considered.
